# React University Finder: Fetching Data from an API

## Overview

This project serves as an evaluation of my university work, showcasing my proficiency in React, API integration, and front-end development skills. The application is a dynamic React-based web application that fetches data from an external API to display information about universities in different countries (6 countries).

## Features

- User-friendly interface with a dropdown menu to select a country.
- Dynamically fetches and displays a list of universities based on the selected country.
- Presents university details in a tabular format with columns for country, name, domain, and website link.
- Implements a sticky header to ensure table headers remain visible while scrolling through the data.

## Technologies Used

- React: Front-end library for building user interfaces.
- HTML, CSS: Markup and styling for the web application.
- Fetch API: Used to make asynchronous API requests to retrieve university data.
- WebKit: Customized CSS styles for the scrollbar.
